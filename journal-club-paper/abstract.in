Needle biopsies using intra-operative imaging assistance
do not currently account for unmodeled needle deflection or
target shift. Positional accuracy can be improved by rotating
a bevel-tipped needle via a closed-loop image compensation
controller. A physician-cooperative approach was used to increase
patient-physician interaction while providing the physician
with robot-assisted accuracy. Needle insertion tests were
performed using this and a fully autonomous system to verify
improvements in accuracy. The cooperative system showed no
statistically significant difference in accuracy from the
autonomous system, with an average accuracy of 3.56mm\textsubscript{rms}
The closed-loop control system was able to compensate for
target shift up to the point where the error approached the
maximum curvature possible for the needle. This shows that
a cooperative, closed-loop control system during a needle
biopsy can improve positional accuracy.
