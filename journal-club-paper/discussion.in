The significance and innovation are presented clearly by the original
authors. This paper strives to present the first cooperative robotic
system for biopsy needle insertion. This allows the physician to take
advantage of robotic positioning accuracy while maintaining close 
contact with the patient. Furthermore, this paper shows that prior
work done on needle steering can be applied practically in a clinical
biopsy setting. Previous work was conducted on solid-core needles 
with limited real-world usefulness. These innovations will lead to
practical clinical devices which will improve physician accuracy
while reducing procedure cost and patient discomfort.

For the feature localization and active compensation portions of the
Materials and Methods, the synopsis authors hold high opinions about
the procedure used by the original authors. Upon researching Farneb\"{a}ck's 
algorithm \cite{Gunnar2003}, we concluded that it was indeed the best
and perhaps most innovative way to localize the needle tip.
The use of two cameras is also a clever
approach. Furthermore, we were enamored by Gang Li's ingenious CURV 
technique \cite{Li2016PhD} used to dynamically calculate the magnitude
and direction of the error for closed-loop compensation. It was not
necessary for the authors of the original paper to choose this bevel
tip based curvature method (other methods could have shown some success as well), 
but the fact that CURV was chosen shows the height
of the innovation of this study.

Reviewing the results of stationary targets led to a few discoveries.  
Three things were discovered since there was not an improvement of accuracy 
between autonomous and user directed cooperative insertions 1) closed-loop 
active compensation is an improvement to open-loop manual insertion, 2) 
lack of degradation of needle moving from autonomous to cooperative 
insertion, and 3) the robot is user-friendly to any skill level. 
Reviewing the results of shifted targets clearly defined that accuracy 
can be maintained up to 5mm which leads to less collection time of 
biopsies in the first insertion. It was clearly noticeable that the 
visual tracking software improved the guiding of insertion which led 
the physician to being more confident.
