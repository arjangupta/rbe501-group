For the feature localization and active compensation portions of the
Materials and Methods, the synopsis authors hold high opinions about
the procedure used by the original authors. Upon researching Farneb\"{a}ck's 
algorithm \cite{Gunnar2003}, we concluded that it was indeed the best
and perhaps most innovative way to localize the needle tip.
The use of two cameras is also a clever
approach. Furthermore, we were enamored by Gang Li's ingenious CURV 
technique \cite{Li2016PhD} used to dynamically calculate the magnitude
and direction of the error for closed-loop compensation. It was not
necessary for the authors of the original paper to choose this bevel
tip based curvature method, but the fact that it was shows the height
of the innovation of this study.
