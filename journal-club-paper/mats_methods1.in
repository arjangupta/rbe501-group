\subsection{Workflow}
The first step for image-guided feedback in cooperative needle insertion is to image a marker so a
mapping from the image to the robot frame can be created. This mapping is then used to transform
the insertion target into the robot frame so the robot can configure itself for a straight line
insertion into the target. Once configured, the physician can initiate cooperative insertion.
During insertion, the controller receives measurements of the needle tip location and target
location, which are created from mapping positions in the image into the robot frame. The
controller fuses these position measurements with measurements of the physician's input force along
with a kinematic state transition model in order to determine the velocity at which the needle
should be inserted as well as how the tip should be oriented in order to closely adhere to the
desired path. Control is terminated once the needle has been inserted to the desired depth or the
needle has strayed too far from the desired path.

\subsection{Needle Placement Manipulator}
The robot used in this study inclued a 4-dof alignment base and a 2-dof cooperative control needle
driver, resulting in a 6-dof system similar to that of \cite{Wartenberg2017} seen in Figure 
\ref{annotated-robot-fig}. The forces applied by the physician as well as the axial needle forces
were measured using MLP-10 aluminum load cell sensors. EM-1-1250 optical encoders were used to
measure robot positions. The motors used for the base, needle insertion, and needle rotation
were USR-60, USR-45, and USR-30 non-magnetic piezoelectric motors. The biopsy system that was used
was the 18G175.

The sbRIO-9651 was the hardware used for the embedded control of the robot. The onboard Artix-7
FPGA was leveraged to handle low-level communication and the provided linux operating system was
used for C/C++ development of the cooperative control algorithms. The controller was previously
shown to work in MR environments by \cite{Nycz2017}.
