\subsection{Feature Localization}
For evaluation of the closed-loop active compensation during cooperatively
controlled needle insertions, we use two cameras to capture real-time
images of the needle tip and target within the robot workspace.
This serves as a proxy for medical imaging, and in fact the compensation
technique is not dependent on the modality of the medical image. The two
cameras are place orthogonal to each other, and are run by a standalone
software application.

In the software application, we employed Farneb\"{a}ck's 
algorithm \cite{Gunnar2003} to execute on captured video frames
to localize the moving needle tip.
