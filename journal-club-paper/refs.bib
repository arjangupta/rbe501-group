   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To measure the mechanical property of prostatic tissues using a minimally motorized indenter and to determine whether measurable differences in mechanical property exist between cancerous and noncancerous tissues in an ex vivo experiment. METHODS: A total of 552 sites from 46 prostate specimens taken during radical prostatectomy underwent an indentation experiment with a minimally motorized indenter, and the elastic modulus (Young's modulus) of the tissue was estimated. RESULTS: The mean elastic modulus of the regions containing cancer and noncancer was 24.1 ± 14.5 and 17.0 ± 9.0 kPa, respectively. In the noncancerous regions, the prostate was separated into 5 parts according to the post hoc test for comparing the elastic modulus between the 2 groups: part 1, lateral apex; part 2, medial apex; part 3, lateral-mid; part 4, lateral base; and part 5, medial-mid and medial base. In the regions containing cancer tissue, the prostate was also separated into 5 parts: part 1, lateral apex and medial apex; part 2, lateral-mid; part 3, lateral base; part 4, medial base; and part 5, medial-mid. The elastic modulus was greater in the tissue with a Gleason score of 8 than in the other tissue. The elastic modulus was significantly greater in the tissue with a tumor volume >5 cm3 than in the other tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We determined the elastic moduli of prostatic tissue as a quantitative and objective parameter according to the regions of the prostate, the presence of cancerous tissue, the tumor volume, and the Gleason score. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Phantoms are a vital step for the preliminary validation of new image-guided procedures. In this paper, the authors present a deformable prostate phantom for use with multimodal imaging (end-fire or side-fire ultrasound, CT and MRI) and more specifically for transperineal or transrectal needle-insertion procedures. It is made of soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and includes a prostate, a perineum, a rectum, a soft periprostatic surrounding and embedded targets for image registration and needle-targeting. Its main particularity is its realistic deformability upon manipulation. Methods: After a detailed manufacturing description, the imaging and mechanical characteristics of the phantom are described and evaluated. First, the speed of sound and stress-strain relationship of the PVC material used in the phantom are described, followed by an analysis of its storage, imaging, needle-insertion force, and deformability characteristics. Results: The average speed of sound in the phantom was measured to be 1380 ± 20 m/s, while the stress-strain relationship was found to be viscoelastic and in the range of typical prostatic tissues. The mechanical and imaging characteristics of the phantom were found to remain stable at cooler storage temperatures. The phantom had clearly distinguishable morphology in all three imaging modalities, with embedded targets that could be precisely segmented, resulting in an average US-CT rigid registration error of 0.66 mm. The mobility of the phantom prostate upon needle insertion was between 2 and 4 mm, with rotations between 0° and 2°, about the US probe head. Conclusion: The phantom's characteristics compare favorably with in vitro and in vivo measurements found in the literature. The authors believe that this realistic phantom could be of use to researchers studying new needle-based prostate diagnosis and therapy techniques. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

This consists in planning optimal strategies and accurately transferring and executing these plans in intra-operative conditions. One clinical purpose is to minimize the intervention invasiveness by increasing the selectivity of anatomical target localization and reducing the aggressiveness of the target access through minimal incisions or natural openings. This generally results for the surgeon in a lack of perception (vision, tactile feeling) and dexterity. It may also raise accessibility problems and may require a higher positional and force accuracy. Therefore, an interface device of some sort is needed in order to connect the 'information world' of images, plans, and computers, to the physical world of surgeons, patients, and tools.

   abstract = {Needle insertion in soft-tissue is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that demands high accuracy. In this respect, robotic systems with autonomous control algorithms have been exploited as the main tool to achieve high accuracy and reliability. However, for reasons of safety and responsibility, autonomous robotic control is often not desirable. Therefore, it is necessary to focus also on techniques enabling clinicians to directly control the motion of the surgical tools. In this work, we address that challenge and present a novel teleoperated robotic system able to steer flexible needles. The proposed system tracks the position of the needle using an ultrasound imaging system and computes needle's ideal position and orientation to reach a given target. The master haptic interface then provides the clinician with mixed kinesthetic-vibratory navigation cues to guide the needle toward the computed ideal position and orientation. Twenty participants carried out an experiment of teleoperated needle insertion into a soft-tissue phantom, considering four different experimental conditions. Participants were provided with either mixed kinesthetic-vibratory feedback or mixed kinesthetic-visual feedback. Moreover, we considered two different ways of computing ideal position and orientation of the needle: with or without set-points. Vibratory feedback was found more effective than visual feedback in conveying navigation cues, with a mean targeting error of 0.72 mm when using set-points, and of 1.10 mm without set-points.},

The robot is constructed of nonmagnetic and electrically nonconductive materials, and is electricity free, using pneumatic actuation and optical sensors. Targeting biopsy lesions of MRI abnormality presents substantial clinical potential for the management of prostate cancer. This paper describes MRI-Safe requirements and presents the kinematic architecture, design, and construction of the robot, and a comprehensive set of preclinical tests for MRI compatibility and needle targeting accuracy. The robot has a compact and simple three degree-of-freedom (DoF) structure, two for orienting a needle-guide and one to preset the depth of needle insertion. The actual insertion is performed manually through the guide and up to the preset depth. To reduce the complexity and size of the robot next to the patient, the depth setting DoF is remote. Experimental results show that the robot is safe to use in any MRI environment (MRI-Safe). Comprehensive MRI tests show that the presence and motion of the robot in the MRI scanner cause virtually no image deterioration or signal-to-noise ratio change. Robot's accuracy in bench test, CT-guided in-vitro, MRI-guided in-vitro , and animal tests are 0.37, 1.10, 2.09, and 2.58 mm, respectively.

Current catheter placement techniques are limited to straight trajectories. The development of an inexpensive system for flexible percutaneous intracranial navigation may be of significant clinical benefit. OBJECTIVE: Utilizing duty-cycled spinning of a flexible bevel-tipped needle, the authors devised and tested a means of achieving nonlinear trajectories for the navigation of catheters in the brain, which may be applicable to a wide variety of neurological diseases. METHODS: Exploiting the bending tendency of bevel-tipped needles due to their asymmetry, the authors devised and tested a means of generating curvilinear trajectories by spinning a needle with a variable duty cycle (ie, in on-off fashion). The technique can be performed using image guidance, and trajectories can be adjusted intraoperatively via joystick. Fifty-eight navigation trials were performed during cadaver testing to demonstrate the efficacy of the needle-steering system and to test its precision. RESULTS: The needle-steering system achieved a target acquisition error of 2 ± 1 mm, while demonstrating the ability to reach multiple targets from one burr hole using trajectories of varying curvature. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the needle-steering system was demonstrated in a cadaveric model. Future studies will determine the safety of the device in vivo.

Although MRI-guided, robot-assisted needle interventions are approaching clinical usage, they are still typically open-loop in nature due to the lack of continuous intraoperative needle tracking. Closed-loop needle-based procedures can improve the accuracy of needle tip placement by correcting the needle trajectory during insertion. This paper proposes a system for robot-assisted, flexible asymmetric-tipped needle interventions under continuous intraoperative MRI guidance. A flexible needle's insertion depth and rotation angle are manipulated by an MRI-compatible robot in the bore of the MRI scanner during continuous multi-planar image acquisition to reach a desired target location. Experiments are performed on gelatin phantoms to assess the accuracy of needle placement into the target location. The system was able to successfully utilize live MR imaging to guide the path of the needle, and results show an average total targeting error of 2.5±0.47mm, with an average in-plane error of 2.09±0.33mm.},

The proposed manipulator takes advantage of four sliders actuated by MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in clinical trials. Results: The manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) of needle placement, which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.

   abstract = {Objective: Permanent prostate brachytherapy is an effective and popular treatment modality for prostate cancer in which long needles are inserted into the prostate. Challenges associated with manual needle insertion such as needle deflection limit this procedure to primarily treat the entire prostate gland even for patients with localized cancer. In this paper, we present a new semiautomated hand-held needle steering assistant designed to help surgeons improve needle placement accuracy. Methods: Regular clinical brachytherapy needles are connected to a compact device that the surgeon holds. As the surgeon inserts the needle, the device rotates the needle base on a measured and calculated basis in order to produce a desired trajectory of the needle tip. A novel needle-Tissue interaction model and a steering algorithm calculate such control actions based on ultrasound images of the needle in tissue. The assistant can also apply controlled longitudinal microvibrations to the needle that reduce needle-Tissue friction. Results: Experimental validation of the proposed system in phantom and ex-vivo biological tissue report an average needle targeting accuracy of 0.33 mm over 72 needle insertions in 12 different experimental scenarios. Conclusion: We introduce a new framework for needle steering in prostate brachytherapy in which the surgeon remains in charge of the needle insertion. The device weighs 160 g, making it easy to incorporate with current insertion techniques. Significance: Expected benefits of the proposed system include more precise needle targeting accuracy, which can result in improved focal treatment of prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Intra-operative imaging is sometimes available to assist needle biopsy, but typical open-loop insertion does not account for unmodeled needle deflection or target shift. Closed-loop image-guided compensation for deviation from an initial straight-line trajectory through rotational control of an asymmetric tip can reduce targeting error. Incorporating robotic closed-loop control often reduces physician interaction with the patient, but by pairing closed-loop trajectory compensation with hands-on cooperatively controlled insertion, a physician’s control of the procedure can be maintained while incorporating benefits of robotic accuracy. A series of needle insertions were performed with a typical 18G needle using closed-loop active compensation under both fully autonomous and user-directed cooperative control. We demonstrated equivalent improvement in accuracy while maintaining physician-in-the-loop control with no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) in the targeting accuracy between any pair of autonomous or individual cooperative sets, with average targeting accuracy of 3.56 mmrms. With cooperatively controlled insertions and target shift between 1 and 10 mm introduced upon needle contact, the system was able to effectively compensate up to the point where error approached a maximum curvature governed by bending mechanics. These results show closed-loop active compensation can enhance targeting accuracy, and that the improvement can be maintained under user directed cooperative insertion.},
