abstract = {This paper presents a novel two-frame motion estimation algorithm. The first step is to approximate each neighborhood of both frames by quadratic polynomials, which can be done efficiently using the polynomial expansion transform. From observing how an exact polynomial transforms under translation a method to estimate displacement fields from the polynomial expansion coefficients is derived and after a series of refinements leads to a robust algorithm. Evaluation on the Yosemite sequence shows good results.},
