\subsection {Tissue Phantoms}
Sampling tissue phantoms was developed and described in Hungr et al \cite{Hungr2012}, Ahn et al \cite{Ahn2010} and Elayaperumal et al \cite{Elayaperumal2014}. The same tissue phantoms were used in the following experiments to mimic needle forces in human-like tissue.  Sampling tissue phantoms were made up of 70\% Plastisol liquid PVC and PVC softener and 30\% Regular Liquid Plastic and Plastic softener from M-F manufacturing (Fort Worth, TX, USA).  

\subsection {Accuracy for Stationary Targets}
The first targeting experiment with static targets had to follow additional criteria to mimic needle forces to produce valid targeting accuracy results.  Such as, the robot was positioned to place the needle tip at an entry point that will give a straight-line trajectory toward the target location and insertions were performed based on three conditions: (1) autonomous insertion with no rotation to characterize $Error_{max}$, which is the needle deflection without active compensation, (2) autonomous insertion with image-guided active compensation, and (3) hands-on user directed cooperative insertion with image-guided active compensation.

A ten-targeted insertion was used to test the hypothesis that targeting accuracy would improve with active compensation and the targeting accuracy would not be negatively affected when moving from an autonomous to cooperative insertion.  All insertions were inserted until it reached the target depth and confirmed by visual confirmation of tip location using the needle tracking software. The results of experiment show the $Error_{max}$ was found to be 9.30 mm$_{rms}$ for no compensation and 3.79 mm$_{rms}$ for active compensation insertions. Testing on stationary target was determined that accuracy showed no statistically significant difference between autonomous insertions with active compensation and user directed cooperative insertions.  The comparison of targeting accuracy of experiment is shown in Fig.~\ref{resultfig1}. Across all insertions the average target depth was 125.23 mm$_{rms}$ and the average targeting accuracy with active compensation was found to be 3.56 mm$_{rms}$.

\subsection {Accuracy for Shifted Targets}
The second targeting experiment with shifted target during cooperative insertions.  The hypothesis was projected that Errormax  would be less than 9.30 mm$_{rms}$ for no compensation since this was achieved with a static target.
A twenty-targeted insertion was used to test this hypothesis in the same setup and tissue as the static experiment.  The difference was once the needle contacted the phantom there was a target shift.  The shift was virtually in the targe plane perpendicular to the insertion axis, with both direction and magnitude assigned randomly.  The range of direction was within 360Â° and magnitude between 1 and 10mm.  The results of experiment show the Errormax was found to be between 2.00 and 6.00 mm$_{rms}$.
\subsection {Accuracy of Feature Localization}
Validating the accuracy of feature localization to ensure the use of needle tracking outputs for robot control. A five-sample insertion was performed in the tissue as the two other experiments.  The camera resolution was 640 x 480 pixels.
The results of experiment showed that the error over the length of all insertions was 10.78 pixels$_{rms}$ along the needle insertion path and 1.05 pixels$_{rms}$ perpendicular to the insertion path.  The phantom boundary was 2.65 and 0.12 mm$_{rms}$.
