Accurate needle placement in deep percutaneous procedures such as
targeted biopsy is critical to reducing procedure time, cost, and
to increase patient comfort by reducing the need for multiple attempts.
Intra-operative imaging can assist with this, but it does not account
for unmodeled needle deflection or target shift. This can be compensated
for by rotating a bevel-tipped needle according to a closed-loop image-guided
control system. A fully autonomous needle insertion system is not desirable
as it typically removes the physician entirely from patient contact, so
a cooperative control system is presented. The physician applies an
input force directly while the active compensation through needle rotation
is performed autonomously.

This work was motivated by the robotics system described in Eslami
\textit{et al} \cite{Eslami2016}. While this system
aligned the needle correctly, it still suffered from positional
inaccuracy introduced by unmodeled needle deflection and target shift.
The goal of this research is to implement a cooperative controlled
needle correction system with closed-loop active compensation. This
system must be compatible with an MR environment and have needle
localization in real-time MR images as shown in Patel \textit{et al} \cite{Patel2015}.

The error in needle accuracy due to deflection, and the amount
of active compensation possible, is limited by the mechanical 
properties of the needle. Prior work to model this has been widely implemented
using the kinematic bicycle model~\cite{Webster2006}
as well as a joint kinematic and dynamic system. \cite{Swensen2012}
Other approaches (\cite{Engh2010}, \cite{Minhas2007}) use a duty-cycled approach for 
needle steering. This approach requires insertion and rotation to
be tightly coupled, prohibiting cooperative control. Rossa \textit{et al}, 
\cite{Rossa2017} presented a similar system with manual
insertion and autonomous rotation, however it did not have a
cooperative insertion approach, which increases the accuracy of the
insertion axis as well.

A cooperative approach was chosen in this system to maintain
phsyician interaction with the patient. Fully autonomous, isolated
solutions are more likely to face increased regulatory scrutiny. \cite{Prasad2003}
Teleoperated systems have been developed to address this issue (\cite{Tse2012}, \cite{Stoianovici2014}, \cite{Pacchierotti2014}).
These systems often employ haptic or vibrational feedback to assist the
physician in positioning the needle, however they still isolate the
physician physically from the patient. A cooperative control scheme
has the benefits of teleoperation while keeping the physician in the
same room as the patient. There are many successful cooperative devices
in use today (\cite{Schneider2000}, \cite{Jakopec2001}, \cite{Bettini2004}, \cite{Megali2001}).

Prior work in steering needles via needle deflection has focused
on thin, flexible needles which are not suitable for a clinical
biopsy scenario. The approach presented here is focused on a
clinical translation. \textit{The primary contributions of this
work are development of a method of closed-loop active compensation
for unmodeled needle deflection and target shift under cooperatively
controlled needle insertion, and experimental validation of this on 
an existing robotic needle placement system with results showing the
accuracy improvements of autonomous needle placement can be 
maintained in user directed cooperative insertion.} \cite{Wartenberg2018}
